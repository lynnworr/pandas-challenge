School and Budget Challenge Analysis

In this analysis, the data presented is an overview of 15 high schools split between District and Charter High Schools. 
The breakdown of data is money allocated to each school, average test scores, number of students attending those schools and passing rate.
The data was broken down to view the different components of each category and compare how District schools measured up to Charter schools.

The two biggest and glaring conclustions that I saw was how school size played a role in overall passing rate and the stricking difference between 
District and Charter schools.

First, schools that had a student population smaller than 2000 students had an average of 90% passing rate, while schools that had over 2000 student population
had about a 60% overall passing rate. Something can clearly be said about having a smaller classroom setting that helps foster learning.

Secondly, as far as District vs. Charter schools, the results can also speak for themselves. With Charter shools, the average test scores across the board 
were higher and when it came to overall passing rate, Charter schools almost doubled the number of children passing, with 90% and 53% respectivly.
